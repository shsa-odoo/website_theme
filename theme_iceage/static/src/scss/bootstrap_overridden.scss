/*
The `bootstrap_overridden.scss` file is typically used to override default Bootstrap variables.
This allows you to customize the look and feel of Bootstrap components without modifying
the Bootstrap source code. By doing this in a separate file,
you can keep your customizations organized and maintain the ability
to update Bootstrap without losing your changes.
